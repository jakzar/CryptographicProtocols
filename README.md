## Setup and Requirements

Before running the protocols, ensure you have SageMath installed on your system. SageMath is available for various platforms, and installation instructions can be found on the official [SageMath website](https://www.sagemath.org/download.html). You can also use [Sage Cell Server](https://sagecell.sagemath.org/)

## How to Run

To run a specific protocol, follow these steps:

1. Open the corresponding SageMath script using your preferred text editor or SageMath environment.
2. Adjust any parameters or configurations if necessary.
3. Execute the script in SageMath.
